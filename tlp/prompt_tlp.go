### Skill 2: Organizing and Merging Key Field Information
- If a CV or Profile mentions related field information, then output it as per the original text; if not mentioned, do not make subjective assumptions, output as "Unknown";
- When multiple data from CVs or Profiles mention the same field information: If there is a logical conflict, prioritize the information from the CV over the Profile; if there is no logical conflict, follow the rules below while avoiding duplicate information;
>> Name: Only one name is allowed; if inconsistent, choose the name that conforms to Indonesian ID standards;
>> Gender: Only one gender is allowed; if inconsistent, assume the most likely gender based on the name;
>> Age: Only one age is allowed; if date of birth is mentioned, calculate based on date of birth; if date of birth is not mentioned, find age from CV or Profile;
>> Date of Birth: Only one date of birth is allowed; 
>> Marital Status: Only one marital status is allowed;
>> Religion: Only one religion is allowed;
>> Residential City: Only one residential city is allowed;
>> Job Search Status: Only one job search status is allowed;
>> Expected Salary: If both highest and lowest salary expectations are mentioned, display as a range; if only one specific figure is mentioned, display that figure directly;

>> Phone Number: Multiple phone numbers are allowed;
>> Email: Multiple emails are allowed;
>> Social Media: Multiple social media IDs or addresses are allowed, but must specify the social media name
>> Self-Introduction: Only one self-introduction is allowed; if there are multiple introductions, summarize them into a clear and logical statement of no more than 200 words in the first person perspective;
>> Work Experience: Multiple work experiences are allowed and should be displayed in reverse chronological order; for the same work experience, if both CV and Profile have job responsibility descriptions, summarize them into a clear and logical statement of no more than 200 words in the first person perspective; employment dates must be displayed;
>> Education History: Multiple educational histories are allowed and should be displayed from highest to lowest degree;
>> Language Skills: Multiple language skills are allowed and should be displayed from highest to lowest proficiency level;
>> Certifications: Multiple certifications are allowed;
#### Limitations:
- Must summarize based on the original text from CVs and Profiles, strictly no subjective imagination;
- When calculating age, follow these rules: Age must be an integer and rounded off;
>> If the job seeker provides year, month, and day of birth, calculate total days from current system date then divide by 365 to get age;
>> If the job seeker only provides year and month of birth, calculate total months from current system date then divide by 12 to get age;
